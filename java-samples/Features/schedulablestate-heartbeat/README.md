# Heartbeat -- Schedulablestate
This CorDapp is a simple showcase of [scheduled activities](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/event-scheduling.html#how-to-implement-scheduled-events) (i.e. activities started by a node at a specific time without
direct input from the node owner).



## Concepts


### Flows

A node starts its com.heartbeat by calling the `StartHeartbeatFlow`. This creates a `HeartState` on the ledger. This
`HeartState` has a scheduled activity to start the `HeatbeatFlow` one second later.

When the `HeartbeatFlow` runs one second later, it consumes the existing `HeartState` and creates a new `HeartState`.
The new `HeartState` also has a scheduled activity to start the `HeatbeatFlow` in one second.

In this way, calling the `StartHeartbeatFlow` creates an endless chain of `HeartbeatFlow`s one second apart.

## Usage

## Pre-Requisites

For development environment setup, please refer to: [Setup Guide](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.10/community/getting-set-up.html).


### Running the CorDapp

Open a terminal and go to the project root directory and type: (to deploy the nodes using bootstrapper)
```
./gradlew clean build deployNodes
```
Then type: (to run the nodes)
```
./build/nodes/runnodes
```


### Interacting with the nodes:

Go to the interactive node shell for PartyA, and run the `StartHeatbeatFlow`:

    start StartHeartbeatFlow

If you now start monitoring the node's flow activity...

    flow watch

...you will see the `Heartbeat` flow running every second until you close the Flow Watch window using `ctrl/cmd + c`:

    xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx Heartbeat xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Lub-dub
