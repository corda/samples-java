# Car Insurance -- QueryableState -- Custom Query

This CorDapp demonstrates how [Custom Query](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.10/community/api-vault-query.html)
works in Corda. Corda allows developers to have the ability to query the vault using multiple mechanisms such as the
Vault Query API, using a JDBC session, etc. This sample demonstrates how to store your state data to a custom database
using an ORM tool and how to query this vault via Vault Query using some custom field defined in your state (for example
a string property of your state). To use Vault Query to query by a certain property the state must implement
[QueryableState](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.10/community/api-states.html#the-queryablestate-and-schedulablestate-interfaces) with a custom mapped schema. This way the DB (and Corda) know what you will be querying By. Please
refer to the flow [InsuranceClaimFlow](./workflows/src/main/java/net/corda/samples/carinsurance/flows/InsuranceClaimFlow.java) for details.

In this CorDapp we would use an `Insurance` state and persist its properties in a custom table in the database.
The `Insurance` state among other fields also contains an `VehicleDetail` object, which is the asset being insured. We
have used this `VehicleDetail` to demonstrate _One-to-One_ relationship. Similarly, we also have a list of `Claim`
objects in the `Insurance` state which represents claims made against the insurance. We use them to demonstrate _
One-to-Many_ relationship.

## Concepts

A spring boot client is provided with the CorDapp, which exposes two REST endpoints
(see [Controller](./clients/src/main/java/net/corda/samples/carinsurance/webserver/Controller.java) in the clients' module) to trigger the flows. Use the command `./gradlew bootRun` in the project root
folder to run the [Spring Boot Server](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#overview).

### Flows

There are two flows in this CorDapp:

1. `IssueInsurance`: It creates the insurance state with the associated vehicle information.

2. `InsuranceClaim`: It creates the claims against the insurance.It uses the Vault Query to perform a custom vault query.

## Usage

## Pre-Requisites

For development environment setup, please refer to: [Setup Guide](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.10/community/getting-set-up.html).

### Running the CorDapp

Open a terminal and go to the project root directory and type: (to deploy the nodes using bootstrapper)

```
./gradlew clean build deployNodes
```

Then type: (to run the nodes)

```
./build/nodes/runnodes
```

### Interacting with the nodes

The Postman collection containing API's calls to the REST endpoints can be imported from the
link: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ddc01c13b8ab4b5e853b. Use the option Import > Import from Link option in
Postman to import the collection. The collection file is also included in this repo for reference.

### Connecting to the Database

The JDBC url to connect to the database would be printed in the console in node startup. Use the url to connect to the
database using a suitable client. The default username is 'sa' and password is '' (blank). You could download H2 Console
to connect to h2 database here:
