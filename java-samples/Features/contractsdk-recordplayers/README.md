# Contract SDK - Record Player Maintenance


If you're familiar with record players you probably know how difficult it is to make sure that they run in pristine condition, especially if it's a collectible.

This CorDapp simulates how you could model the process of a limited edition record player (the cordagraf) that is manufactured and issued to specific dealers, and those dealers are the only entities that can service those record players after the fact and report stats back to the manufacturer about how the players are being used.

Record Players are issued as `LinearState`s and are updated by dealers, that act functionally as the only entity that can update the `RecordPlayer` state.


### Using the Contract SDK

The [Contract SDK](https://github.com/corda/contract-sdk) is a series of annotations that you can use in your corda contracts. It's great for putting together cleaner contract code and writing it faster.

This repository demonstrates how you can configure and use it in your own projects.

Configuration is essentially three small steps:

- add `maven { url 'https://software.r3.com/artifactory/corda-lib-dev' }` to `repositories.gradle`
- add `compile "com.r3.corda.lib.contracts:contract-sdk:0.9-SNAPSHOT"` to the `build.gradle` file of your contract module in your CorDapp
- add  the annotations to your apps!


To show how convenient this can be, here's an example demonstrating how to configure a simple issuance command with one output and no inputs.

```java
// note the annotations here from the Contracts SDK
@RequireNumberOfStatesOnInput(value = 0)
@RequireNumberOfStatesOnOutput(value = 1)
class Issue implements Commands {}
```

If you've written contracts before you might be used to outlining the verify method, applying a conditional for issuance commands and configuring a lot of the same verification for contract inputs. This removes the need for those tools.

Take a look at the small RecordPlayerContract sample in this repository to see how this works in practice.

## Pre-Requisites
For development environment setup, please refer to: [Setup Guide](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.10/community/getting-set-up.html).


## Usage

To run the CorDapp, just use the gradle wrapper script the same way you normally would.


    ./gradlew clean build deployNodes
    ./build/nodes/runnodes

In the Manufacturer's interactive shell, type:

    flow start net.corda.samples.contractsdk.flows.IssueRecordPlayerFlow dealer: "O=Alice Audio,L=New York,C=US", needle: spherical

    # you can get your state id with a quick vault query
    run vaultQuery contractStateType: net.corda.samples.contractsdk.states.RecordPlayerState
    
    flow start net.corda.samples.contractsdk.flows.UpdateRecordPlayerFlow stateId: < Place State ID here >, needleId: spherical, magneticStrength: 100, coilTurns: 100, amplifierSNR: 10000, songsPlayed: 100

## Additional Information

If you're looking to find more information on record players specifically, I included some sources for how we modeled record players in the state class.
