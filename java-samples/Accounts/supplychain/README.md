From the above chart, you can see the flow is going back and forth between different parties' accounts. Please follow the instruction below to experience the [Accounts](https://training.corda.net/libraries/accounts-lib/) library. 


## Pre-Requisites

For development environment setup, please refer to: [Setup Guide](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.9/community/getting-set-up.html).

## Runnning the nodes
Go into the project directory and build the project
```
./gradlew clean build deployNodes
```
Run the project
```
./build/nodes/runnodes
```
Now, you should have four Corda terminals opened automatically.

## Shell Instructions (Part 1) - Creating & Sharing Accounts
Go to the Buyer's node terminal and paste in the following code: (You can select all 7 lines and copy to the terminal all at once)
```

flow start CreateNewAccount acctName: BuyerWarehouse

flow start ShareAccountTo acctNameShared: BuyerProcurement, shareTo: Seller
flow start ShareAccountTo acctNameShared: BuyerFinance, shareTo: Seller
flow start ShareAccountTo acctNameShared: BuyerWarehouse, shareTo: ShippingCo
flow start ShareAccountTo acctNameShared: BuyerWarehouse, shareTo: Seller
```
This is creating 3 accounts under Buyer's node and sharing with their specific counterparty's node or account.

Go to the Seller's node terminal and paste in the following code: 
```
flow start CreateNewAccount acctName: SellerSales
flow start CreateNewAccount acctName: SellerFinance
