### [World Cup Ticket Booking](./worldcupticketbooking):

This sample shows you how to integrate accounts and tokens. This sample talks about a scenario where typically when the Cricket season starts, BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket) starts selling tickets. As of now there are multiple dealers whom the BCCI issues tickets and further these dealers sell tickets to their client. We are trying to simulate similar functionality maintaining the entire issuance and selling of the tickets on Corda Platform.
