# stock pay dividend

This CorDapp aims to demonstrate the usage of [TokenSDK](https://training.corda.net/libraries/tokens-sdk/), especially the concept of [EvolvableToken](https://training.corda.net/libraries/tokens-sdk/#evolvabletokentype) which represents stock.
You will find the StockState extends from EvolvableToken which allows the stock details(eg. announcing dividends) to be updated without affecting the parties who own the stock.

## Concepts

### Parties

This CordApp assumes there are 4 parties:

* **WayneCo** - creates and maintains the stock state and pays dividends to shareholders after some time passes.
* **Shareholder** - receives dividends base on the owning stock.
* **Bank** - issues fiat tokens.
* **Observer** - monitors all the stocks by keeping a copy of of transactions whenever a stock is created or updated. (In reality, this might be a financial regulatory authority like the SEC.)


Here's the flows that exist between these parties :

![Flow diagram](./diagrams/FlowDiagram2.png)


This Stock Exchange CorDapp includes:
* A bank issues some money for the final settlement of the dividends.
* A company/stock issuer(WayneCo) issues and moves stocks to shareholders
* The company announces dividends for shareholders to claim before execution day
* Shareholder retrieves the most updated stock information and then claims dividend
* The company distribute dividends to shareholders


### Keys to learn
* Basic usage of TokenSDK
* How the state of stock (ie. EvolvableToken) updates independently without stock holders involved
* Use of `TokenSelection.generateMove()` and `MoveTokensUtilities.addMoveTokens()` to generate move of tokens
* Adding observers in token transactions with TokenSDK

*Note that some date constraint(eg. payday) is being commented out to make sure the sample can be ran smoothly


### States
* **[StockState](./contracts/src/main/java/net/corda/samples/stockpaydividend/states/StockState.java)** -
which holds the underlying information of a stock like stock name, symbol, dividend, etc.  
* **[DividendState](./contracts/src/main/java/net/corda/samples/stockpaydividend/states/DividendState.java)** -
represents the dividend to be paid off by the company to the shareholder. 

## Usage

### Running the CorDapp

Open a terminal and go to the project root directory and type: (to deploy the nodes using bootstrapper)
```
./gradlew clean deployNodes
```
Then type: (to run the nodes)
```
./build/nodes/runnodes
```
### Running the sample
To go through the sample flow, execute the commands on the corresponding node

##### Pre-requisite. IssueMoney - Bank
In order to pay off dividends from the company later, the bank issues some fiat tokens to the WayneCo.
This can be executed anytime before step 6.
>On bank node, execute <br>`start IssueMoney currency: USD, amount: 500000, recipient: WayneCo`

##### 1. IssueStock - Stock Issuer
WayneCo creates a StockState and issues some stock tokens associated to the created StockState.
>On company WayneCo's node, execute <br>`start CreateAndIssueStock symbol: TEST, name: "Stock, SP500", currency: USD, price: 7.4, issueVol: 500, notary: Notary`

##### 2. MoveStock - Stock Issuer
WayneCo transfers some stock tokens to the Shareholder.
>On company WayneCo's node, execute <br>`start MoveStock symbol: TEST, quantity: 100, recipient: Shareholder`

Now at the Shareholder's terminal, we can see that it received 100 stock tokens:
>On shareholder node, execute <br>`start GetStockBalance symbol: TEST`

##### 3. AnnounceDividend - Stock Issuer
WayneCo announces the dividends that will be paid on the payday.
>On WayneCo's node, execute <br>`start AnnounceDividend symbol: TEST, dividendPercentage: 0.05, executionDate: "2019-11-22T00:00:00Z", payDate: "2019-11-23T00:00:00Z"`


##### 4. ClaimDividendReceivable - Shareholder
Shareholders finds the dividend is announced and claims the dividends base on the owning stock.
>On shareholder node, execute <br>`start ClaimDividendReceivable symbol: TEST`

##### 5. PayDividend - Company
On the payday, the company pay off the stock with fiat currencies.
>On WayneCo node, execute <br>`start PayDividend`

##### 6. Get token balances - Any node
Query the balances of different nodes. This can be executed at anytime.
> Get stock token balances
<br>`start GetStockBalance symbol: TEST`

>Get fiat token balances
<br>`start GetFiatBalance currencyCode: USD`

#### Test cases
You can also find the flow and example data from the test class [FlowTests.java](workflows/src/test/java/net/corda/examples/stockpaydividend/FlowTests.java).
