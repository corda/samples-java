# spaceships-javaAPIs token sample cordapp 

## IMPORTANT: this project is using TokenSDK Pre-signed developer snapshot pending the formal release. NOT FOR PRODUCTION. This repo will be updated when available.

```java
tokens_release_group = 'com.r3.corda.lib.tokens'
tokens_release_version = '1.2-RC02-PRESIGN'
```

---
This CorDapp demonstrates the new Java APIs released with [TokenSDK](https://training.corda.net/libraries/tokens-sdk/) 1.2

For an exploratory overview of usage, checkout the following blog post: [here](https://medium.com/corda/corda-tokens-made-easy-with-new-java-apis-83095693d72)

The core changes include easier access to the following Utility classes and functions from Java:
- com.r3.corda.lib.tokens.money
  - MoneyUtilities
  - DigitalCurrency
  - FiatCurrency 
- com.r3.corda.lib.tokens.selection
  - SelectionUtilities
  - TokenQueryBy
- com.r3.corda.lib.tokens.selection.database.config
  - DatabaseSelectionConfig
- com.r3.corda.lib.tokens.selection.database.selector
  - DatabaseTokenSelection
- com.r3.corda.lib.tokens.contracts.utilities
  - AmountUtilities
- com.r3.corda.lib.tokens.workflows.utilities
  - FlowUtilities
  - NotaryUtilities
  - QueryUtilities
  - TokenUtilities
  
Additionally two new Java Builder classes have been added to allow easy creation of both [Fungible](https://training.corda.net/libraries/tokens-sdk/#fungibletoken) and [NonFungible](https://training.corda.net/libraries/tokens-sdk/#nonfungibletoken) Tokens:
- FungibleTokenBuilder
- NonFungibleTokenBuilder

The CorDapp will allow International Planetary Council (IPC) residents to use their local currencies to either purchase unique spaceships (represented by NonFungibleToken) OR invest in partial ownership of a spaceship (represented by a FungibleToken). 

Examples of the new Java APIs will be used throughout and identified as such.



## Concepts


### Flows

Flows are executed through the `FlowTests` class in the workflows module. They can also be run through the [CRaSH](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/shell.html) shell.

## Pre-Requisites

For development environment setup, please refer to: [Setup Guide](https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html).

## Usage

### Running the CorDapp

Open a terminal and go to the project root directory and type: (to deploy the nodes using bootstrapper)
```
./gradlew clean deployNodes
```
Then type: (to run the nodes)
```
./build/nodes/runnodes
```

### Interacting with the nodes

#### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.

You can use this shell to interact with your node.
